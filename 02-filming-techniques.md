# Filming Techniques for Construction Content

## Essential Shot Types

### 1. Wide Establishing Shots

**Purpose:** Set the scene, show scope of work

**How to frame:**
- Stand far enough to capture entire work area + context
- Position horizon in upper or lower third (not center)
- Shoot from 45-degree angle for depth
- Include sky for visual breathing room

**What to include:**
- Full building facade or renovation area
- Context elements (driveway, landscaping)
- Workers when activity adds energy

### 2. Detail/Craftsmanship Close-ups

**What makes them compelling:**
- Tight focus on textures (wood grain, stone, tile patterns)
- Hands in action (not faces) showing skilled work
- Tool-to-material contact moments

**Technique:**
- Get within 12-18 inches of subject
- Fill 80%+ of frame with detail
- Tap screen to lock focus
- Use natural light for texture definition

**High-impact details to capture:**
- Precision miter joints in trim
- Custom tile patterns
- Hardware installation
- Paint/finish application

### 3. Progress Shots (Same Angle Over Time)

**The "Fixed Camera" Method:**

1. Choose a corner with good visibility
2. Mark floor with tape (small "X")
3. Note phone height (eye level, chest, etc.)
4. Take reference photo of standing position
5. Use gridlines and align to fixed point each time

**Timing:**
- Daily: Fast-moving phases (framing, drywall)
- Weekly: Slower phases (trim, finish)
- Milestones: Demo complete, framing done, paint finished

### 4. Before/During/After Sequences

**The 3-Part Formula:**

| Phase | What to Capture |
|-------|-----------------|
| Before | Current "worst" state, problem areas visible |
| During | Peak activity, 3-5 workers, tools in frame |
| After | Clean, staged, identical angle to "before" |

**Tip:** Shoot "before" and "after" in same lighting conditions.

### 5. Time-Lapse Setup

| Work Duration | Interval | Final Video |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| 30 minutes | 1 second | ~15 seconds |
| 1 hour | 2 seconds | ~15 seconds |
| 4 hours | 4-5 seconds | ~30 seconds |
| Full day | 10 seconds | ~30-45 seconds |

**Setup checklist:**
- [ ] Tripod secured (no movement allowed)
- [ ] Connected to power (sessions over 30 min)
- [ ] Phone shielded from direct sun (overheating)
- [ ] Area won't be disturbed

**Best activities for time-lapse:**
- Demolition (dramatic transformation)
- Framing (skeleton to structure)
- Flooring installation (patterns emerging)
- Painting (color transformation)

### 6. Reveal Shots

**The "Door Reveal" Technique:**
1. Start with camera facing closed door
2. Slowly push door open while walking through
3. Continue slow push into revealed space
4. Hold final wide shot 3-4 seconds

**The "Cloth Drop" Reveal:**
- Cover completed feature with drop cloth
- Film pulling away the cloth
- Works great for countertops, fixtures

**The "Swipe Transition":**
- Film hand swiping across lens in "before" state
- Film reverse swipe in "after" state
- Edit together for seamless transition

### 7. Worker/Team Shots

**What works:**
- Hands-focused shots (measuring, cutting)
- Profile shots during focused work
- Team collaboration moments
- Tool belt/gear shots

**What to avoid:**
- Staged "thumbs up" poses (inauthentic)
- Unflattering angles (shooting up at people)
- Workers unaware of filming (get consent!)
- Faces during strenuous work

### 8. Equipment/Tool Shots

**Types that perform well:**
- Clean, organized tool layouts (flat lay)
- Tools in action (saw cutting, drill driving)
- Specialized equipment demonstrations

## Composition Rules

### Rule of Thirds

Enable gridlines on camera. Place key elements at intersection points:

| Element | Placement |
|---------|-----------|
| Horizon/floor line | Upper or lower third line |
| Doorways/windows | Vertical third lines |
| Key feature | Intersection point |
| Worker in frame | Any intersection |

### Leading Lines

**Natural leading lines in construction:**
- Floor joists converging
- Stud walls creating corridors
- Trim and baseboards
- Staircase railings
- Countertop edges

**How to use:** Position so lines lead FROM edge INTO center of frame.

### Depth & Layering

**The 3-Layer Method:**

| Layer | Distance | What to Include |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Foreground | 0-3 feet | Partial element (door frame, tool) |
| Midground | 3-15 feet | Main subject (work area) |
| Background | 15+ feet | Context (windows, walls) |

## Movement Techniques

### Smooth Pans (Horizontal)

- Move LEFT to RIGHT (matches reading direction)
- Keep elbows tucked against body
- Rotate from waist, not arms
- **Speed:** 5-7 seconds for 90-degree pan

### Tilts (Vertical)

- Start at floor, slowly tilt up to ceiling
- Rotate from waist
- **Speed:** 3-5 seconds for full tilt

**Rule:** "If it feels too slow, it's probably right."

### Walking Tracking Shots

**The "Glide Walk":**
1. Bend knees slightly
2. Walk heel-to-toe, rolling motion
3. Hold phone at chest level, both hands
4. Keep elbows tight to body
5. Walk at HALF normal pace

**Important:** Clear path of obstacles first!

### Slow Push-Ins

- Start wide, slowly walk toward subject
- End on detail or feature
- Takes 4-8 seconds
- Keep subject centered

### Orbit Shots

1. Stand 4-6 feet from subject
2. Keep subject centered
3. Sidestep in arc while rotating
4. Maximum 180-degree arc
5. Takes 8-12 seconds

**Best for:** Kitchen islands, freestanding tubs, fireplaces

### Static vs. Moving

| Use STATIC When | Use MOVEMENT When |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Capturing fine detail | Showing scale of space |
| Time-lapse recording | Creating immersive feel |
| Before/after comparison | Revealing completed work |
| Text overlay planned | Following action |

## Lighting Solutions

### Best Times of Day

| Time | Light Quality | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Golden hour (1hr after sunrise/before sunset) | Warm, soft | Exteriors, rooms with windows |
| Overcast | Natural diffusion | Detail work |
| Blue hour (20 min after sunset) | Dramatic | Completed exteriors with interior lights |
| 10 AM - 4 PM | Harsh | AVOID for exteriors |

### Dark Interior Solutions

1. Turn on ALL available lights
2. Open all window coverings
3. Use LED fill light
4. Position subject near windows
5. Embrace moody aesthetic for Stories

### Mixed Lighting Fix

**The problem:** Different color temperatures look unflattering.

**Solutions:**
- Commit to one source (turn off artificial OR cover windows)
- Shoot toward windows
- Fix white balance in editing
- Use consistent light types

### Dust Particles

**When it's aesthetic:**
- Dramatic beams through windows
- Short clips, intentional mood

**When problematic:**
- Heavy clouds obscuring subject
- Final reveal shots (should feel clean)

**Fix:** Wait 10-15 minutes after heavy work for dust to settle.

## Safety While Filming

### PPE Always Visible

**Always show:**
- Hard hats in active areas
- Safety glasses during operations
- Work boots (never sandals)
- High-vis when required

**Why:** Demonstrates professionalism, protects from liability.

### Zones to Avoid Filming

**Never film:**
- Active electrical panels
- Overhead crane/lift operations
- Confined spaces
- Excavation edges
- Areas with fall hazards visible

### Awareness Rules

**The "3-Second Rule":** Every 3 seconds, quickly check surroundings.

**Pre-filming checklist:**
1. Identify exit path
2. Note overhead work
3. Check footing stability
4. Alert nearby workers

**Never film while:**
- Walking backward
- On ladders or scaffolding
- During overhead operations

### What NOT to Capture

**Safety violations (obvious):**
- Workers without required PPE
- Unsafe ladder use
- Missing guardrails

**Subtle issues:**
- Extension cords through water
- Blocked egress paths
- Visible permits (show address)

## High-End Renovation Specifics

### Showcasing Quality Materials

**Techniques:**
- Macro shots showing grain, texture
- Slow pans across seamless joints
- Light reflecting off polished surfaces
- Worker hands touching/finishing

**Materials worth close-up:**
- Natural stone (each slab unique)
- Custom millwork
- Hardware (brass, bronze, specialty)
- Artisan tile work

### Architectural Details

**Interior:**
- Crown molding, ceiling details
- Custom built-ins
- Archways, architectural openings
- Staircase details
- Fireplace surrounds

**Exterior:**
- Roofline and eave details
- Column and porch details
- Custom entry doors
- Stone/brick patterns

### Client Privacy (Even With Consent)

**Always exclude:**
- Personal photos and artwork
- Full addresses (blur house numbers)
- Mail, documents, calendars
- Security codes/keypads
- Pet photos or children's artwork
