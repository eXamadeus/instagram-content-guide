# Instagram Best Practices (2024-2025)

## Algorithm Overview

Instagram uses **multiple algorithms** - different systems for Feed, Reels, Stories, and Explore.

### Key Ranking Signals (In Order)

1. **Watch Time** - How long people view your content
2. **Shares/Sends** - Top signal for reach (Instagram prioritizes content that "brings people together")
3. **Saves** - Indicates high-value content
4. **Comments** - Meaningful interactions
5. **Likes** - Still matters but less than shares/saves

### What This Means for Construction Content

**Focus on creating content people want to:**
- **Share** with friends planning renovations (transformation reveals)
- **Save** for future reference (educational tips, before/after inspiration)
- **Watch to completion** (satisfying reveals, time-lapses)

---

## Reels Best Practices

### Optimal Length

| Duration | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| 15-30 seconds | Quick reveals, satisfying clips |
| 30-60 seconds | Transformations, tutorials |
| 60-90 seconds | Complex stories, walkthroughs |

**Rule:** Under 90 seconds performs best.

### The First 3 Seconds (Critical)

The hook determines if viewers watch or scroll. Start with:

- Something visually striking
- A question or curiosity gap
- Text overlay that promises value
- The "before" of a dramatic transformation

**Examples:**
- "Wait until you see the after..."
- "This $200K kitchen was built in 6 weeks"
- [Shot of destroyed space] → "3 months later..."

### Performance Boosters

| Do This | Avoid This |
|---------|------------|
| Add captions/subtitles | Low-resolution video |
| Include audio (music or voice) | TikTok watermarks |
| Use original, non-watermarked content | No audio at all |
| Use creative tools (text, effects) | Too much text |
| Loop your Reels (increases watch time) | Recycled content from other apps |

### Reels vs. Other Formats

| Format | Reach Potential | Best Use |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Reels** | Highest | Discovery, transformations, viral potential |
| **Carousels** | Medium-High | Educational, detailed info, save-worthy |
| **Single images** | Medium | Portfolio shots, team photos |
| **Stories** | Followers only | Daily updates, BTS, polls |

## Posting Strategy

### Best Times (Construction Industry)

Based on analysis of 1M+ posts:

## Hashtag Strategy

### Do Hashtags Still Matter?

**Yes, but less than before.** Keywords/SEO in captions are now more important.

### Optimal Number

**3-5 relevant hashtags** per post (Instagram's official recommendation)

### Strategy: Mix Broad + Niche + Location

**Broad (high volume):**
- #homerenovation
- #homedesign
- #renovation
- #interiordesign
- #beforeandafter

**Niche (targeted):**
- #kitchenremodel
- #bathroomrenovation
- #luxuryrenovation
- #residentialrenovation
- #homecontractor

**Location (essential for local business):**
- #[city]renovation
- #[city]contractor
- #[city]homedesign
- #[city]remodel

### Placement

Caption or first comment - no significant difference. Keep captions clean by placing hashtags in first comment if using many.

---

## Caption Optimization

### First Line = Most Important

This appears in preview before "more" button. Make it count:

- **Hook with curiosity:** "The one thing most homeowners forget..."
- **Hook with result:** "This kitchen took 6 weeks and $85K"
- **Hook with question:** "Would you have chosen marble or quartz?"

### Caption Structure

```
[Hook - visible in preview]

[Story or value - 2-3 sentences]

[Call-to-action]

[Hashtags - 3-5]
```

### Keywords for SEO

Instagram search now indexes caption text. Include naturally:
- "[City] home renovation"
- "Kitchen remodel"
- "Bathroom renovation"
- "Luxury renovation"
- "Residential contractor"

---

## Instagram SEO

### Profile Optimization

**Name field:** Include keywords
- Example: "Smith Renovations | Luxury Home Remodeling"

**Bio:** Include location + services
- Example: "High-end residential renovations in [City]. Kitchens | Bathrooms | Whole Home. Free consultations."

**Link in bio:** Use trackable link (UTM parameters)

### Alt Text

Add descriptive alt text to every image:
1. Tap "Advanced settings" when posting
2. Add alt text describing the image
3. Include keywords naturally (don't stuff)

**Example:** "Modern white kitchen with marble countertops and gold hardware in Atlanta home renovation"

---

## Call-to-Action Strategy

### CTA Types by Goal

| Goal | CTA Examples |
|------|--------------|
| Lead generation | "Book your free consultation - link in bio" |
| Engagement | "Save this for your renovation inspiration" |
| Reach | "Share with someone planning a kitchen reno" |
| Recruitment | "DM 'CAREER' for current openings" |
| Website traffic | "See the full tour - link in bio" |

### CTA Placement

- **In video:** Lower-third text in last 5 seconds
- **Caption:** End of caption, after value delivery
- **Bio:** Clear action ("Book free consultation")

### Effective CTA Formulas

**For lead generation:**
"Planning a renovation? DM us 'START' for our free planning checklist"

**For engagement:**
"Save this for your renovation mood board"

**For shares:**
"Tag a friend who needs to see this transformation"

## Link-in-Bio Setup

### Recommended Tool: Linktree Pro ($9-15/mo)

Or create custom landing page for full brand control.

### What to Include (Priority Order)

1. **Book a Consultation** - Primary CTA (most prominent)
2. **View Our Portfolio** - Gallery/case studies
3. **Free Guide Download** - Lead capture
4. **Current Projects** - Behind-the-scenes
5. **We're Hiring** - Recruitment (toggle on/off)
6. **Client Reviews** - Social proof
7. **Contact Info** - Phone, email, service area

## Engagement Best Practices

### Responding to Comments

- **Reply within first hour** if possible
- Every reply counts as additional engagement
- Ask follow-up questions to continue conversation
- Use replies to add value (answer questions fully)

### Engaging with Others

- Interact with complementary businesses (architects, designers, real estate)
- Comment meaningfully on relevant posts
- This helps algorithm understand your niche

### Collaboration Opportunities

- **Instagram Collabs** - Co-shared authorship splits engagement
- Partner with: Interior designers, real estate agents, home stagers
- Both accounts get reach benefit

### What to Avoid

- Engagement bait ("Like for..." or "Comment 'YES'")
- Follow/unfollow schemes
- Purchased followers or engagement
- Excessive tagging or irrelevant hashtags
