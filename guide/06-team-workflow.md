# Team Workflow Guide

## Recommended Model: Hybrid

**Managers film + do basic edits → One person finalizes**

### Why This Model Works

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Quality control | Finalizer catches inconsistencies |
| Distributed workload | No bottleneck on one person |
| Manager investment | Each person learns core skills |
| Brand consistency | Single point of polish |
| Redundancy | If finalizer unavailable, managers can still create |

### Role Breakdown

**Site Managers (5 people):**
- Film on site (10-15 min per visit)
- Basic edit (20-30 min per video)
- Upload to "FOR REVIEW" folder

**Finalizer (1 person):**
- Add brand elements, music, captions
- Quality check (15-20 min per video)
- Move to "APPROVED" folder

**Approver (1 person - could be owner/marketing):**
- Final sign-off
- Schedule or publish
- Review takes 5-10 min per video

## Content Assignment

### Option A: Project Ownership (Simple)

Each manager responsible for their projects:
- Manager A: Smith Kitchen → all Smith content
- Manager B: Johnson Bath → all Johnson content
- etc.

**Pros:** Simple, clear ownership
**Cons:** Uneven content if projects vary

### Option B: Content Type Ownership (Recommended)

| Manager | Content Type |
|---------|--------------|
| A | Before/after reveals |
| B | Process/how-we-work |
| C | Detail/craftsmanship |
| D | Team/behind-scenes |
| E | Client testimonials |

**Pros:** Consistent quality, specialization
**Cons:** Requires coordination for project access

### Option C: Rotating Weekly

One manager "on duty" each week for all content.

**Pros:** Ensures consistency
**Cons:** May miss opportunities on other sites

## Avoiding Duplicate Content

### Prevention Methods

1. **Shared content calendar** (Later provides this)
2. **"Claim" system:** Mark in calendar when starting a post
3. **Weekly 10-min standup** (async in Slack/Teams)
4. **Color coding** by manager in calendar

### Weekly Async Update Template

Post in team channel every Friday:

```
Manager: [Name]
This week filmed: [X posts]
In review: [X posts]
Next week opportunity: [Description]
Help needed: [None / specific request]
```

## Batch Production Tips

### Film for Multiple Posts in One Visit

**Per site visit, capture:**
- Wide establishing shot
- 3-5 detail/progress clips
- B-roll moments (tools, hands, materials)
- Quick team moment

**Result:** One visit = footage for 2-3 posts

### Same-Angle Progress System

1. Mark 3-4 positions per project with tape
2. Photograph exact positions
3. Return to these spots weekly
4. Compile for powerful transformation reels

### Capture-to-Use Ratio

- **Film:** 15-20 minutes raw footage per visit
- **Use:** 2-4 minutes across multiple posts
- **Ratio:** 5:1 to 10:1 is normal
