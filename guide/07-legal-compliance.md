## Client Permission

### When Written Permission is Required

**Always get written permission for:**
- Any interior photography/video of a residence
- Before/after content featuring the property
- Content that could identify the property location
- Any commercial use (marketing, advertising, portfolio)

### What to Include in Property Release

1. **Parties:** Company name, client name(s), property address
2. **Scope:** What can be filmed (exterior, interior, specific rooms)
3. **Use:** Social media, website, advertising, print
4. **Duration:** How long company may use content
5. **Rights:** Reproduction, distribution, modification
6. **Revocation:** Whether/how permission can be withdrawn
7. **Signatures:** All property owners must sign

### When to Get Permission

| Timing | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| Contract signing | Include as part of initial agreement |
| Before filming | At minimum, get verbal confirmation |
| Before posting | Final check if significant time has passed |

### If Client Changes Mind

**Establish upfront:**
- Content already posted: Stays or must be removed?
- Unpublished content: Delete or retain (unused)?
- Time limits: Revocation period (e.g., 30 days)?
- Notice: Require written revocation requests

**If revoked:**
- Act promptly to honor request
- Document all communications
- Do not create content about the situation

## Worker/Employee Consent

### Do Employees Need Releases?

**Yes - obtain written consent from all employees who may appear in content.**

**Why:**
- Protects company from later claims
- Clarifies expectations upfront
- Required in some states for commercial use
- Demonstrates professionalism

### Subcontractor Considerations

- Subcontractors are NOT your employees
- Get separate releases from subcontractor companies AND individuals
- Include media release requirements in subcontractor agreements
- Some may refuse - respect their decision

### What If Someone Doesn't Want to Be Filmed?

- **Respect their wishes immediately**
- Film around them or wait until they're not on site
- Never pressure or create hostile environment
- Do not retaliate or discriminate
- Consider "film days" with only consenting workers

### Can You Require Consent as Employment Condition?

**This is legally complex - consult an attorney.**

**Generally problematic:**
- Courts have found mandatory consent can be coercive
- California, Illinois, others have strong employee protections
- Could create discrimination claims

**Safer approaches:**
- Make consent voluntary
- Obtain at hiring as part of documentation (not as condition)
- Allow employees to opt out without penalty

## Music Licensing

### Documentation to Keep

For every track used, save:
- Song title and artist
- Platform licensed from
- License type and date
- Permitted use cases
- License certificate or screenshot

### Consequences of Unlicensed Music

| Level | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Low | Content muted automatically |
| Medium | Video removed |
| High | Copyright strike on account |
| Severe | Legal demand letter |
| Worst | Lawsuit ($750-$150,000 per violation) |

### Safe Music Sources

- Instagram's built-in library (limited for business)
- Epidemic Sound, Artlist, Soundstripe (subscription)
- Stock music with commercial license
- Original compositions (with work-for-hire agreement)

**Ensure:**

- Consistent for everyone in frame

### OSHA Considerations

- Filming should not distract from safety-critical tasks
- Camera operators need appropriate PPE
- Keep equipment out of work zones
- Don't film during high-risk operations

### Accidentally Captured Unsafe Conditions

**If you capture unsafe conditions:**
1. Do NOT post the content
2. Address the safety issue immediately
3. Do not delete if there's been an incident (evidence preservation)
4. Review all footage before posting

## Intellectual Property

### Using Architect/Designer Work

## Privacy & Data

### Address Visibility

**Risks:**

- Violates privacy expectations

**Best practices:**

- Avoid geographically identifying landmarks
- Use general area references ("Buckhead renovation")

### Geotagging

**Disable or use cautiously:**
- Instagram can embed location data
- Reveals project locations in real-time
- May violate client expectations

**Options:**

- Get client permission before location tagging

2. Document the complaint in detail
3. Review your releases and permissions
4. Consult attorney before responding to legal threats
5. Respond professionally and promptly
6. Take down content if clear violation
7. Document all actions taken

**Escalate to attorney if:**
