### Documentation to Keep

For every track used, save:
- Song title and artist
- Platform licensed from
- License type and date
- Permitted use cases
- Screenshot of license terms

### What Happens With Unlicensed Music

| Risk Level | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| Low | Content muted automatically |
| Medium | Video removed |
| High | Copyright strike on account |
| Severe | Legal demand letter |
| Worst | Lawsuit ($750-$150,000 per violation) |

## Recording Audio On Site

### When to Use Site Audio

**Use ambient audio when:**

- Demonstrating process
- Quick BTS clips

**Skip ambient audio when:**

- Multiple conversations
- Want polished/cinematic feel

### iPhone Voiceover Tips

**Recording location:**
- Quietest space available
- Your vehicle (naturally sound-dampened)
- Closet with clothes (absorbs echo)
- Early morning before site gets busy

**Technique:**
- Hold phone 6-8 inches from mouth
- Enable airplane mode (no interruptions)
- Speak at consistent volume
- Face away from noise sources
