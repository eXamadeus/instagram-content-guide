## Exposure & Focus Lock (Critical Skill)

### The AE/AF Lock Technique

1. **Tap and HOLD** on your subject until "AE/AF LOCK" appears
2. **Slide finger up/down** to adjust brightness
3. Lock remains until you tap elsewhere

### When to Use

- **Interior shots:** Lock on a wall or surface (not windows)
- **Exterior shots:** Lock on the building, not the sky
- **Walking shots:** Re-lock when moving between bright/dark areas
- **Detail shots:** Lock directly on the subject
